## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **JavaScript Exclusion Logic:**
```javascript
if (form.action.includes('logout') || 
    form.action.includes('register') || 
    form.action.includes('cars') ||
    form.action.includes('suppliers')) {
    return; // Skip loading spinner
}
```

### **Form Handling Pattern:**
```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    button.disabled = true;
    button.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-spinner fa-spin me-2"></i>Processing...';
    // Let form submit normally
});
```
