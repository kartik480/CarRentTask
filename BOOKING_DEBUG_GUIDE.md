### **2. Check Car Status:**
The car might not be approved or available.

**Test:** Try booking a different car from the cars list.

### **3. Database Connection:**
There might be a database connection issue.

**Test:** Check if you can access other pages like `/cars` or `/admin/dashboard`.

### **4. Missing Dependencies:**
Some required packages might be missing.

**Test:** Run `composer install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

### **5. Cache Issues:**
Laravel caches might be causing issues.

**Test:** Clear all caches:

php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```
